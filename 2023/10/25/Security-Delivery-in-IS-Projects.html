<p>Safety occupies an increasing proportion in the delivery of product projects and integration projects in civil aviation, customs and other business sites, especially with the increase of new products and solutions implemented overseas, and security, privacy-related regulations, industry norms, international standards, contract clauses and other constraints are becoming more and more complex and diverse, and at the same time, the security needs in the specific delivery process are also diverse, such as governance requirements for products, solutions, suppliers, compliance needs, operational needs, audit needs, etc. This greatly increases the difficulty and cost of project delivery. If there is no systematic response, then throughout the project management process, endless security requirements will become the biggest obstacle to project delivery, making the project lost in a large number of safety regulations and vague safety items, resulting in project schedule delays, increased costs, team fatigue, reduced customer satisfaction, and even project fines, and in severe cases, project execution failure. The audit-based IS project safety delivery scheme describes a safety management framework and process assurance guidance based on the idea of safety audit, takes product safety as the starting point and the safety delivery process as the end, describes the specific safety management methodology, countermeasures and goals of all aspects of the framework, and forms a proactive and systematic project security requirements delivery scheme with cost-effectiveness as the ultimate goal.</p>

<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>In the delivery of IT projects, including IS projects, integration projects, hardware product projects, and security-related content delivery is gradually comprehensive and deep, from a single security clause to a comprehensive IT security requirements specification; From security at the network level to security in integrated systems; From compliance to penetration testing; From secure delivery to security O&amp;M; From security technology to security management, it covers all aspects related to security: compliance, physical security, management security, communication security, operational security, security testing, among which the terms of management and technology are gradually balanced, and security delivery is gradually in line with typical security frame theory. In particular, the security of integrated systems occupies an increasing proportion in the delivery of product projects and integrated projects in civil aviation, customs and other business sites, especially with the increase of new products and solutions implemented on a global scale, and security, privacy-related regulations, industry norms, international standards, contract clauses and other constraints are becoming more and more complex and diverse, and at the same time, the security requirements in the specific delivery process are also diverse, such as governance requirements for products, solutions, suppliers, compliance needs, operational needs, Audit requirements, etc., greatly increase the difficulty and cost of project delivery.</p>

<p>At the same time, the project customer gradually has a more professional IT management team, can be very professional to complete the procurement, testing, certification, installation of IT/IS system, as well as a relatively complete test acceptance process, in the whole process of security control also has a very professional, strict quality assurance process, such as the physical and network isolation of the test plant and the production site, the admission review of the supplier executive team, remote access control, network and server configuration authority management, change management approval, review, Implementation of IT security control policies, such as domain control, system upgrade and version control, configuration management, software system security design, access control design, etc. Customers have a clear understanding and need for regulations, contract terms, and security design, such as GDPR, CE certification, operational requirements, encryption security levels, etc., and relevant items can also put forward clear requirements for suppliers through contract terms.</p>

<p>If there is no systematic response, then throughout the project management process, endless security requirements will become the biggest obstacle to project delivery, making the project lost in a large number of safety regulations and vague safety items, resulting in project schedule delays, increased costs, team fatigue, reduced customer satisfaction, and even project fines, and in severe cases, project execution failure.</p>

<p>Audit-based IS project security delivery scheme A security management framework and process assurance guidance based on security audit ideas, including specific security management methodology, countermeasures and goals in all aspects of IS project related product design, development, delivery, operation and maintenance, forming a proactive and systematic project security requirements delivery scheme with cost-effectiveness as the ultimate goal. Traditional audit tends to procurement, operation and maintenance, including the audit needs of suppliers and customers, which refers to the use of open standards, principles, methods, guidelines, practices and technologies to plan, implement, evaluate and review the design, development, delivery, operation and maintenance of business or information systems and related processes</p>
